# [3.0.0](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/compare/v2.0.3...v3.0.0) (2019-07-16)


### Code Refactoring

* make AGNES algorithm closer to R ([#11](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/issues/11)) ([1517124](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/commit/1517124))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* - use the Lance-Williams algorithm to update cluster distances.
- add other methods that exist in R.
- remove `ClusterLeaf` class and use an `isLeaf` property instead.
- remove `index` array from clusters. Instead, an `indexes()` method has been added to compute it.
- add a `size` property to clusters that indicates the number of leaves below it.
- the default `method` is now `'complete'`.
- DIANA has been removed from the package pending rewriting it.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/compare/v1.3.0...v2.0.0) (2019-05-02)


### Code Refactoring

* **agnes:** rename `options.kind` to `options.method` ([acabbe6](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/commit/acabbe6))
* rework options and write TS definitions ([f49c7af](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/commit/f49c7af))
* rewrite project as ESM and use rollup ([f02ad0a](https://github.com/mljs/hclust/commit/f02ad0a))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **agnes:** `options.kind` was renamed to `options.method` in `agnes`.
* the `disFunc` option was renamed to `distanceFunction`.
* Node.js 4 and 6 are no longer supported.
